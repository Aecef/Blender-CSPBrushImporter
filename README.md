<summary>PNG Fails To Automatically Load Into Blender</summary>
<p align="center">

#### Currently Blender does not like the way the PNG is saved by the addon and will give an error in the texture panel.

#### This is currently fixed by saving a copy over the original image then reloading the image from the texture panel
#### Make sure to save over ther original with the same name

#### Back in Blender hitting the refresh Icon will reload the image and should remove the error
